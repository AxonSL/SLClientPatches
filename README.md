# SLClientPatches
This Repo contains all files and Patches required to remove the AntiCheat from the Game SCP:SL

## Disclaimer
This is not for hack clients! We don't support any kind of hack client for the game. These patches are for offline mode no auth only! 

You can't play on regular servers with this and we won't provide support to create a hack client!

## .1337 Files
Those files are generated using x64dbg and can be used inside that porgramm while debugging the SCPSL.exe.

## .patches
This is a file format from us deviating from .1337.

It is easier for Installers to read and removes all the offsets that makes patching in non-runtime really hard.

I personally recommend to use a programm like HxD to apply those patches manually when you don't want to use the installer.
